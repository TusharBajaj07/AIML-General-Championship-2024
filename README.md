## Project Overview
This project utilizes a comprehensive dataset of dermatological images, including skin conditions such as Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC), Actinic Keratosis (AKIEC), Dermatofibroma (DF), and others. The aim is to preprocess and classify these images using advanced deep learning techniques to assist in accurate diagnosis.

## Dataset
The dataset includes labeled images of skin conditions and is preprocessed using techniques such as:
- Image resizing
- Normalization
- Data augmentation

Ground truth labels and features were analyzed to understand patterns before model training.

## Model Architecture
The project uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, which are highly effective for image classification tasks. Key components include:
- **TensorFlow** and **Keras** frameworks
- **Dropout layers** to prevent overfitting
- **Adam optimizer** to improve performance

```python
# Example of CNN model definition
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(128, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dropout(0.5),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
